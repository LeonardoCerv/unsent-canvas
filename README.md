Unsent Canvas is an anonymous, real-time collaborative note canvas. Users can place short notes anywhere on an infinite shared space. The project is inspired by The Unsent Project, but reimagined as a spatial, interactive canvas for open expression.

I created Unsent Canvas because I truly love the idea of giving people a space to share thoughts, feelings, and messages without barriers. The concept of anonymous, public notes, where anyone can contribute and see the collective story unfold. This project is a labor of love, built to make that dream a reality.

## Features

- Infinite canvas: Click anywhere to create a note. Pan and zoom freely.
- Real-time collaboration: See new notes appear instantly as others write.
- Anonymous and public: No login required. All notes are visible to everyone.
- Customizable notes: Choose colors, position, and recipient for each note.
- Rate limiting and cooldown: Prevents spam with client-side and server-side controls.
- Content moderation: Automated filtering for profanity, spam, and inappropriate content.
- Reporting system: Users can report notes for review.
- Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, screen reader announcements, and responsive UI.
- Modern UI: Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, and Sonner for notifications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- Supabase project (for database and real-time backend)

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeonardoCerv/unsent-canvas.git
cd unsent-canvas
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create a `.env.local` file with your Supabase credentials:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
ADMIN_API_KEY=your_secure_admin_key
```

### 3. Set Up Database

Run the SQL script in `database-setup.sql` using Supabase SQL Editor. This will:

- Create the `notes` table with secure Row Level Security (RLS)
- Enable public read, server-only write
- Add rate limiting and moderation infrastructure

### 4. Start the App

```bash
npm run dev
```
